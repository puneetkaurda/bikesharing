## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this challenge was to create visualizations in Tableau to present to investors regarding a bikesharing business. These visualizations show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The "Checkout times for Users" visualization shows that most number of bike rides are 5 to 10 minutes long.

The results shows that there is a large percentage of male riders. It also revealed that most people use the service on a subscriber basis. Additionally, the analysis showed that the most popular times to ride are  around 5 or 6 pm. 
Citibike NYC showed there is a potential to expand bike sharing services to Des Moines, Iowa. Although bikesharing services is mostly utilized by male riders, female riders also tend to be consistent in their bike riding usage. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 215,408 residents in Des Moines, with a median age of 34. Of this,49.13% are males and 50.87% are females, whereas NYC is comprised of 52.3% of females. This could be an indication that ridership among females in Des Moines could lead to similar trends.


## Summary

According to the Des Moines's tourism website, there are three popular trails that would make ideal bike riding places for not only residents but tourists as well. Each trail is about a 6-9 mile ride which could attract bike enthusiasts. Lastly, Des Moines scenic outdoors, history, and culture could also attract ridership as they are eager to explore and most importantly there is is good number of trails which are mostly paved and is suitable for all skill levels. 
If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:
 the "LOCATION" which plays a big role in growing the bike business. The trip starting and ending locations in NYC is an example of popularity more than many others.

The "Top Starting Locations" visualization shows that "12th Ave and W40th street" is most famous starting Location.

The "Top Ending Locations" visualization shows that "Pershing Square North" is the most famous ending Location.
